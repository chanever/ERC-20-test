# MetaMask Token Transfer Guide

This guide provides a simple walkthrough on how to transfer your test ERC20 tokens to MetaMask.

## Adding Your Test Token to MetaMask

1. **Open MetaMask** - Launch the MetaMask extension in your browser.

3. **Add Token** - Click on 'Add Token' at the bottom of the main view.
4. **Select Custom Token** - Switch to the 'Custom Token' tab.
5. **Enter Token Contract Address** - Paste the contract address of your test token. MetaMask will auto-fill the Token Symbol and Decimals.
6. **Add the Token** - Click 'Next' and then 'Add Tokens'.

## Transferring Tokens Using MetaMask

1. **Access Your Token** - Find your token under 'Assets' in MetaMask.
2. **Initiate a Transfer** - Click on the token, then click 'Send'.
3. **Enter Recipient Address** - Type in the address you want to send tokens to.
4. **Specify Amount** - Enter the number of tokens you wish to send.
5. **Confirm and Send** - Click 'Next', review the transaction details, then click 'Confirm' to send your tokens.

## Viewing Your Transactions

- **MetaMask Activity** - Your transaction will appear in the 'Activity' tab of MetaMask.
- **Etherscan** - For detailed transaction history, visit [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and enter your token's contract address or your personal address.

Remember, transferring tokens will require Ether in your account to pay for gas fees. Ensure you have enough ETH in your MetaMask wallet before initiating a transaction.

This guide assumes you already have MetaMask installed and set up. If not, you can download MetaMask from [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) and follow the setup instructions.
